Emoji.js is a plugin to convert your typing to colourful twitter emoji to use on your website or projects.

Place `<script src="http://cdn.rawgit.com/ashleighy/emoji.js/master/emoji.js.js"></script>` in your HTML file after your jQuery script.

*OR*

1.  Place `<script src="/path/to/emoji.js"></script>` in your HTML file after your jQuery.
2.  Place the Emoji folder in your img folder and Emoji.js in your js folder. 

Then take a look at the cheatsheet for available codes and get typing! All Emoji are written between {braces}.
